### 👋 Hi there 

🧬 I am currently harnessing generative AI to address the most complex challenges in Biology for advancements in drug discovery.

🌟 I have published 3 research papers in ML. One of the papers was published at CVPR and has over 200+ citations and 1.5K+ Github stars.

🎓 In the summer of 2023, I earned my Master of Science in Computer Science, specializing in ML, from Purdue University, achieving a GPA of 3.6/4.0.

🖥️ During my final year of graduate studies, I served as a Research Assistant at Kihara Lab, one of Purdue University's premier ML research facilities. There, I employed generative deep learning models for intricate protein structure analysis and built an ML serving infrastructure for these computation-intensive models (visit em.kiharalab.org).

👻 In the summer of 2022, I joined Snap Inc.'s Camera Platform team as a Machine Learning Engineer intern. My role involved developing and deploying a deep learning-based optical flow prediction model to automate Snapchat's video annotation process. This initiative enhanced video labeling and annotation efficiency by 15% for Snapchat's gigantic unlabelled video datasets.

🛰️ In my first year of graduate study, I collaborated with Viasat Inc. through Purdue's The Data Mine program as a Graduate Data Science Researcher. My research focused on developing Deep Learning algorithms to tackle blind image super-resolution challenges, intended specifically to enhance the quality of Viasat's internal satellite imagery.

🕸️ Before my relocation to the US, I completed five internships in India, focusing on ML in the topics of News sentiment analysis, ML in finance, Sports vision analysis, Document understanding, Optical Character Recognition, Face Recognition, Fine-grained image classification, Chatbots, etc.

🏅 I was the Smart India Hackathon (India's biggest Hackathon) grand finalist three times. During which, I worked on ML-based projects for ISRO, ITC Ltd, and DRDO (India's esteemed organizations).
