### 👋 Hi there 

✨ I have strong enthusiasm for **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. 

🖥️ Pursuing **Bachelor's of Engineering in Information Technology** with an overall **CGPA of 9.4** and have been consistently in the top 5 of my class.

📄 Published **two research papers** both in the ML/DL domain, one of which published at the **CVPR 2020 conference** (the topmost computer science conference in the world).

🌟 One of my open-sourced **Github** repositories has **800+ stars and 200+ forks**. Planning to build more such projects.

👨‍💻 Completed **five internships**, all of which in the ML/DL domain. Consistently worked on solving challenging industry and business problems with ML/DL.

🏆 Loved participating in various **competitions and hackathons**. Reached three times at the **Smart India Hackathon** (India's largest Hackathon) grand finale. Worked on the ML/DL-based projects of **ISRO**, **ITC ltd**, and **DRDO** (India's esteemed organizations). 

🥇 Recently started with **Kaggle**. Trying to gain experience and medals.
